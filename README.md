# Repository - PhysiLab2d

This repository contains the software **PhysiLab2d**, along with its documentation and research article, which addresses the challenge of **Increasing Student Engagement in Physics Education**. <br>

The software was developed as a **capstone project (TCC)** for the **Software Engineering** program at the **Centro Universitário Católica de Santa Catarina, Jaraguá do Sul Campus**.

<h4> Access the app: [PhysiLab2d Application](https://math-learning-5e0f0.web.app/login) <br> </h4>

## About the Project

Physics education, particularly at the high school level, faces significant challenges that impact student engagement and learning outcomes. Traditional teaching methods, lack of resources, and excessive teacher-centered approaches often result in students memorizing formulas rather than developing a genuine interest in the subject.

To address these challenges, **PhysiLab2d** integrates interactive computational activities with experimental learning, leveraging the "Predict, Interact, and Explain" (PIE) method proposed by Tao & Gunstone (1999). This pedagogical approach encourages students to predict the behavior of physical systems before engaging with simulations, fostering a deeper understanding of scientific concepts.

### Key Features:
- Developed using **React.js** (with the Matter.js library) and **Firebase** to create an interactive and engaging online platform.
- Supports dynamic simulations to help students grasp complex physics concepts through practical application.
- Includes user feedback cycles with physics teachers to refine and enhance the platform.

The platform simplifies experimental processes, integrates modern technology, and makes physics more accessible and engaging for students.
